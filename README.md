# Email-Spam-Detection
### Overview:

This project aims to develop a simple email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on certain features extracted from the email content.

#### Features:

#### Text Processing: 
The system uses natural language processing techniques to extract features from the text of emails.

#### Machine Learning Model:
A machine learning model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to predict whether a given email is spam or not.

#### Requirements
Python 3.x
#### Dependencies: 
listed in requirements.txt
#### Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
#### Data Preparation: 
Prepare your email dataset with labeled examples (spam/ham) and split it into training and testing sets.

#### Feature Extraction: 
Use the provided script to preprocess and extract features from your email dataset.

#### python extract_features.py --input_dataset path/to/your/dataset.csv --output_features features.csv
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the extracted features.

python train_model.py --input_features features.csv --output_model spam_model.pkl
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether a new email is spam or not.

python predict.py --input_email path/to/your/email.txt --model spam_model.pkl
